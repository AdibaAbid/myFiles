# js-todo-list
A repo for student of tech karo to implement JavaScript in a practical way

## Reference
This is an exercise from Recurship Training Material for frontend

## Objective
This exercise is designed to test out your application architecture skills. Now that you have some command over JS, you will use the knowledge to create a simple frontend application. You will learn to create and manage objects, refactor and play with local storage. This is also where you should extensively use the Chrome Dev tools to help you move through the exercise.

## Requirements:


## Setup 
- Setup the codebase.
- Scafold the code usign Yeoman [skip]
- Initialize the git repo
- Create a new git repo on GitHub
- Invite your mentor to this new repo

## Day 1

Create a new branch named as step-1-interface from master and do the following

### Create the interface
An example interface is already given in the image linked above, you DO NOT need to make it look exactly the same, something similar will work fine. Use any framework and keep the styling to a minimal.

Create a new branch named as step-2-implementation from step-1-interface and do the following

### Implement the basic implementation that covers point 1 and 2
No need to think about persistance for now, that will be done in the end. However you should structure the code likewise. Once completed please inform the mentor for getting the code checked. You will be using core JavaScript for all DOM manipulation (Reference: plainjs.com)

## Day 5

### Implement feature relating to point 10

## Day 6

### Extend the webpack file to create a build process (update the prepare task)

- It should concat all JS / CSS files
- It should minify all the JS / CSS files
- It should run JS Hint on all JS files
- It should remove the dev code

## Day 8, 9

- Write test to check application loaded
- Write tests for adding new tasks
- Write tests for editing new tasks
- Write tests for deleting tasks
- Write tests for checking filters

## Day 10

## Using the documentation at protractor (https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/page-objects) convert your test to Page Object pattern
